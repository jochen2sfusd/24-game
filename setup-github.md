# GitHub Repository Setup

Since we don't have GitHub CLI installed, here's how to set up your repository manually:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `24-game`
3. Description: `A web-based implementation of the classic 24 game`
4. Make it **Public** (for background agents to access)
5. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push Your Code

After creating the repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Verify the remote is set correctly
git remote -v
```

## Step 3: Enable Background Agents

Once your repository is on GitHub:

1. Go to your repository settings
2. Look for "Actions" or "GitHub Actions"
3. Enable Actions if not already enabled
4. Background agents should now be able to access your code

## Step 4: Test the Game

Your game should be running at: http://localhost:3000

If you need to restart the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Next Steps

Once the repository is set up, you can:

1. **Add more games** to the collection
2. **Implement leaderboards** with a backend
3. **Add user authentication**
4. **Create multiplayer features**
5. **Deploy to Vercel/Netlify** for public access

The code is structured to easily add these features incrementally!
